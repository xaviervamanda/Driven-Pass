# 🔒 Driven Pass

This application is a password manager inspired by password managers like 1Password, BitWarden and LastPass.

Using different and secure passwords is the best way to protect yourself on the internet. For a password to be secure, it must contain several characters and numbers mixed together, not to mention that the longer it is, the better.

But how are you going to memorize giant passwords with no semantic meaning? It is to solve this pain that password managers emerged! With them, you only create one “master” password and all other passwords are kept secret! So, when you need it, just remember the “master” password!
